# Che_Math
This repository was created to collect all the coded-related homework and projects developed within the course $Mathematical$ $Methods$ $in$ $Chemical$ $Engineering$ from the Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department at the University of Pittsburgh. The programming languages used for this purpose are Julia and Python.

## Project 2: Kinetic parameter estimation from experimental dataset using Julia

Missing data: The legend covers one of the lines and makes it impossible to recover this data.
Color overlapping: Due to the presence of multiple profiles and therefore colors, in some cases there is an overlapping of the profiles. If we were to zoom in, it would be evident that some fragments of the curves overlap others.
Dotted lines: Also, the style of the line becomes an additional constraint when it is dotted, and its trend is difficult to follow.

Together these three factors generate additional noise which leads to slightly different results when fitting the parameters.
