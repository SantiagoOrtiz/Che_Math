    "We've spent a lot of time discussing the \"null distribution\".\n",
    "- The null hypothesis for a 1 sample t test is that the mean of the normal population our data comes from is equal to our hypothesized mean, $\\mu$. Therefore, the null distribution is the distribution of t values we expect to observe if we randomly sample from a normal population that has a mean equal to our hypothesized mean, $\\mu$.\n",
    "- The null hypothesis for a 2 sample t test can be more nuanced, depending on the assumptions we make about each samples standard deviations. Here, we will consider the independent, equal sample size, equal variance two-sample t test.\n",

Instead, we have to use nonparametric statistical tools wherein we do not have to make any assumptions on whether our data comes from a specific population. One option is the U statistic from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n",
