    "# Bootstrapping to estimate parameter ranges of nonlinear models\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first introduced ourselves to regression, we focused the regression algorithm’s ability to find the “truth”, i.e. how close to the true parameter values does the algorithm get.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and boostrapping, the truth is (typically) unknown and there is noise associated with any given measurement. So our question becomes “how confident am I that the parameters of my model are not zero?” And as discussed in class, all kinds of challenges arise when using bootstrapping. Here, we'll try a simple example.\n",

    "You have been provided with data, called \"Homework11 Data.csv\". Use this data for the following excercises. In this file, you'll find the time points sampled and the concentration of bacterium (y) for 5 independent experiments. We will consider data to be independent across time and experiments.\n",

    "In the space below, load the data and write the code to fit the parameters of our model to the data using minimize or fsolve. You may want to revisit your previous homeworks. To make things a little easier, I'll give you the first guess for your parameter. Go with (a,b) = (0.3,0.8). After fitting:\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that both a and b are greater than 0. Use the bootstrap method to create distributions of estimates of our parameter values. We can do this by, **for each iteration:**\n",
    "   - Resample the data at each time point using sample with replacement (search online how to do).\n",
    "   - Use minimize to refit the model to the resampled data\n",
    "   - Save the fitted parameter estimates and the value of the cost function.\n",

After completing, plot histograms of the fitted parameter values and cost function values. Figures must be clearly labeled and obvious to read. \n",
